            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping
                people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important
                for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to
                make it better.

                Learning in a library
                Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups can do
                things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic,
                academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal
                education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or

                plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Informal education is less organized.It may be a parent (like a dad
                or mom) teaching a child how to make a meal or ride a bicycle. People can also get an informal education
                by reading many books from a library or educational websites. This may also be called self-education.
                Some famous people have been largely self-educated, like Alfred Russell Wallace
                Deschooling is a more drastic approach. It advocates abolishing schools. It was put forward in the USA
                of the 1960s and 1970s. It is no longer an active movement.
